# Your Own Plugins
The plugin folder contains a wide range of research plugins created and shared by users from around the world.

However, there may be times when you want to modify an existing plugin or create a new one that fits your specific needs—even if it’s not particularly useful to others.

That’s where the MyPlugins folder comes in. It’s the perfect place to store your own customized plugins.

# Activating and Deactivating Plugins
Plugins in the MyPlugins folder can be activated and deactivated just like the core plugins. The process is exactly the same.

# Writing Your Own Plugin
To write a plugin, you’ll need a basic understanding of the PHP programming language.
If you're not sure where to start:
- Read the main [Readme file][1] which contains detailed instructions to create your own plugin.
- Take a look at the core plugins to see how they’re structured.
- Check the examples folder, which includes:
    - A sample custom plugin to guide you.
    - A blank plugin template with all the necessary functions to get started.
